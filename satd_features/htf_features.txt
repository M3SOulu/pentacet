major flaw,

literally nothing,
this is incorrect,

special cheat[s]*,

do not use unless you are sure,
is terribly wrong,
useless here,
strange bug,
strange enough,
bug gives,
small trick,
sound strange,
isn't a great,
intentionally lazy,
work correctly only if,
bit slack,
weird block,
recurse indefinitely,
can[\s]*not deal,
this is vulnerable,
undocumented so far,
completely useless,
many issues,

easiest solution,
something terrible,

viable solution,
this is gross,

doesn[']*t work hence,
slight hack,
small issue,
issues to resolve,
silly optimization,
mem[(ory)]* waste,
it[']*s lame,
could refactor,
burning cpu,
e[s]*entially useless,
inherent risk,
better way of fixing,
^not needed$,
best way to get around the problem,
fix compatibility,
this should be considered,
strange happens,
fairly nasty,
[(silently)?\s]*ignore inconsistencies,
not necessary to invoke,
added here as convenience,
very mad,
won[']*t compile with,
should be reasonably,
unexpected loss,
but if it doesn't,
doesn't make a whole lot of sense,
not necessary yet,
still not implemented,
for it to work,
doesn[']*t work perfectly,
current issue,
definitely bad,
would be more precise,
poor implementation,
useless impl,
nasty trick,
lighten it,
useless for this,
somewhat buggy,
this is still ugly,
hate this so much,
not sure how well,
only way to fix,
not necessary to call,
is horribly wrong,
primary cause,
feels sloppy,
broken package,
odd choice,
is wrongly called,
counter productive,
may be later,
dirty [(little)\s]*shortcut,
far from being perfect,
unsafe at present,
for work properly,
inconsistent code,
hence this hack,
weird observation,
had [\w\s*]*bugs,
slow route,
earliest version supported,
the nasty,
hard\s*coded but,
lazy processing,
this should be impossible,
does this lazily,
mac hack,
weird code,
tricky problem,
significantly worse,
why both of,
will be processed later,
^don[']*t care$,
temp patch,
move it temporarily,
just temporary for,
crap like this,
not necessary to declare,
short term solution,
pretty weak,
yet to be agreed,
least risky,
such loss,
should be no[-]*op,
windows hack,
work required on,
considered unsafe,
need to reexamine,
appears to be bug,
quite stupid,
fucking idiot,
weak code,
hell yeah,
higher risk,
make it scale,
eliminate [\w\s*]*complexity,
flickering like hell,
to stop weird,
major security implications,
non sense,
could not deal,
